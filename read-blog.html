                    <h1>7 Fun Ways to learn CSS By Playing Games</h1>
                    <small>June,2020</small>
                    <p>Learning CSS can be a frustrating experience sometime. One of the best things about learning to
                        code is that people who are good at coding also happen to have the skills to make games that
                        teach other people to code.

                        Here are some games which help you to master CSS.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <div>
                            <li style="background-color: #75c9c8;" class="link link-primary margin-md">Flexbox froggy <br/>
                                <small>This game is about Flexbox and it covers flex properties like align-items,
                                    justify-content, align-content, flex-direction, align-self, flex-wrap, flex-flow and
                                    order in 24 different levels.

                                    Yeah, last level is bit challenging</small><br/><br/>
                            </li>
                            <li style="background-color:#80a1d4; " class="link link-primary margin-md">Flexbox Zombies <br/>
                                <small>Here we use Flexbox to position the hero’s crossbow and hit the zombies and
                                    survive along the game.
                                    Each section unravels part of the plot, gives you expertise over a new flexbox
                                    concept, and presents zombie survival challenges that force you to solidify your new
                                    skills like your life depends on it.</small><br/>

                            </li>
                            <li style="background-color:#c0b9dd; " class="link link-primary margin-md">Flexbox defense <br/>
                                <small>
                                    Flexbox defense is based on the classic tower defence games, but to place our items
                                    we write CSS instructions. We use the justify-content property on the main container
                                    to move the single towers into effective positions.

                            <li style="background-color:#ded9e2; " class="link link-primary margin-md">Grid Garden <br/>
                                <small>
                                    Grid Garden game features 28 levels, starting with easy difficulty and gradually
                                    increasing it. Use the various grid properties to water and grow your carrot garden.
                                    Grid Garden has a code editor and visual area so you instantly see your result.

                                <small>
                                    CSS Battle is more of an online challenge than an actual CSS practice game, the
                                    objective is to write HTML and CSS code to replicate the given target image in the
                                    least code possible. This game is constantly updated with new challenges. It has a
                                    global ranking system and the ability to re-play each challenge so you can improve
                                    your own results.

                                <small>
                                    The CSS Diner webapp is really fun and genuinely educational for developers of all
                                    skill levels. You’ll go through 26 different levels of increasing difficulty. The
                                    first few levels teach core fundamentals like element selectors and class selectors.
                                    In the later levels you’re working with advanced concepts like :only-of-type and
                                    :not(x).

                                    We already checked Grid Garden and Flexbox Froggy, you’ve seen some examples of
                                    CodePip’s work already.
                                    Those are just the two free games they offer. If you sign up for a pro account on
                                    their site, they also have games that range from general CSS review to JavaScript.
